                Async functions enable us to write promise based code as if it were synchronous, 
                but without blocking the execution thread. 
                It operates asynchronously via the event-loop. 
                Async functions will always return a value. 
                Using async simply implies that a promise will be returned, 
                and if a promise is not returned, 
                JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise with its value.
